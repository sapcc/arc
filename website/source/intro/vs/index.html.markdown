# Arc vs. Other Software

The problems Arc tries to address have been solved by many different systems before. Although there is no single system that provides all the features of Arc, there are other options available to solve some of these problems.

In this section, we compare Arc to different systems that operate in the same problem domains and try to illuminate the similarities and difference between Arc and those systems.

Due to the bias of the comparisons being on Arcs website, we attempt to only use facts. Also we be no means claim to be experts on all of the mentioned systems. So if you find something that is invalid or out of date in the comparisons, please open an issue and we'll address it as soon as possible.
