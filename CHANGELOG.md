**Implemented enhancements:**

- **Nodes auto renew cert [\#134](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/134)**   
Task that checks every specific period of time the expire date of the node cert and in case that the expiration time is less than 1 month renew it.

**Implemented enhancements:**

- **Create changelog [\#122](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/122)**   
Implement an autogeneratable changelog that is easier readable and more condensed than the commit history for others to track what we have been working on.

**Fixed bugs:**

- **Automation powershell script fails [\#145](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/145)**   
Trying to run a powersehll script on a windows machine fails with `%1 is not a valid Win32 application`.

## [2018.7/8](https://github.com/monsoon/arc/tree/2018.7/8) (2018-08-31)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/monsoon/arc/compare/2018.5/6...2018.7/8)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- **Add cert expiration fact [\#140](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/140)**   
Add a new fact that reports the left hours to the cert expiration date.
- **Extend agent install script with the renew cert URL [\#138](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/138)**   
Extending the agent script with the renew cert URL will be needed / useful when initializing the arc node and afterwards when using the renewCert command or the auto renew cert function.
- **Check mosquitto and arc-api images for vulnerabilities [\#135](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/135)**   
Add a task in steps mosquitto-build and api-build to check for vulnerabilities in the pipeline.
- **Command to renew the node certs [\#131](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/131)**   
Write a command that renews the certs on the node side.
- **Optional Start API Server with TLS [\#127](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/127)**   
To be able to auto renew the certificates by the nodes we need first to run the API server with TLS. Running the Server with TLS we are able to extract the CN, OU and O from the certificate used on the tls communication.
- **Run integration tests against QA [\#125](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/125)**   
Decided to run the integration Tests against QA. Staging is not anymore reliable.
- **Upgrade go to v10 and change dependencies manager to dep [\#123](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/123)**   
First upgrade to go v10 and compile the project to check everything works fine. Afterwards change GoDep dependencies manager to Dep since GoDep ist outdated and not anymore manteined.
- **Initial Trust: One-Time Token & Launch-Index [\#49](https://gitHub.***REMOVED***/monsoon/arc/issues/49)**   
As far as I understand, the motivation for extending the openstack metadata server is, that you want to pass the same user-data into the batch-creation call and passing a \*\*one\*\*-time token in user-data for multiple machines does obviously not work.
